### WELLNESS JOURNEY NOTICE

Our Health & Longevity Reports offer guidance on your personal wellness journey. These reports reflect insights based on the information you've shared with us, but they're meant to complement—never replace—the wisdom and care of health practitioners.

### A PARTNERSHIP IN WELLNESS

Your HealthDataLab report serves as a conversation starter with your healthcare team. While our AI-powered tools analyse your self-reported information to provide personalised insights, these insights require interpretation by qualified professionals who understand your unique health story.

### HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE

Remember that true wellness embraces the whole person. Our assessments offer one perspective on your health journey, but they cannot capture the full complexity of your individual biology, life circumstances, or health history.

### ACCURACY CONSIDERATIONS

Your report's accuracy depends on:

- The information you've provided
- The inherent limitations of our assessment models
- The evolving nature of health research

Our Health Calculator and assessments are designed for informational and educational purposes only. They provide general indications of health based on self-reported data and cannot detect, diagnose, or treat medical conditions.

### A COMMITMENT TO YOUR JOURNEY

While we believe in the value of our insights, we cannot guarantee specific health outcomes. Your body's wisdom and your intuition are vital companions to any health data or recommendations.

## DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY
