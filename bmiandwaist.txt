Your Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist-Hip Ratio are standard indicators of physical health. BMI offers a broad measure of weight relative to height, while Waist-Hip Ratio highlights fat distribution, which can signal risks like cardiovascular issues. 

Although these metrics are far from perfect, as you implement healthier nutritional choices, physical movement practices, and stress management techniques and moreâ€¦  these numbers will reflect your progress. So their main benefit is in observing changes in these metrics over time, reflecting your commitment to wellness.
