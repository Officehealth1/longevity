Below is a structured approach, addressing first how to design and layout the report for premium appeal, and second, highly refined and precise AI prompts for each report section.

Part 1: Recommendations for Premium Report Design and Layout
Given that your current setup uses a WP page, JavaScript, HTML, and "PrintFriendly," here’s how you can significantly elevate the design quality to match a high-end luxury experience:

General Design Guidelines:
Clean and Minimalist Aesthetic:

Ample whitespace.

Minimal colour palette: soft greys, whites, and muted accent colours (e.g., teal, sage, or navy).

Modern serif fonts (e.g., Playfair Display) for headings paired with clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter or Montserrat) for body text.

Interactive Visuals:

Dynamic charts (Polar/radar, gauge charts).

Smooth interactive animations (light fade-in, transitions).

Clearly highlighted actionable areas (buttons/CTAs).

Consistent Visual Language:

Uniform iconography (thin line style icons).

Subtle shadowing or border radius to sections/cards.

Technical Recommendations:
Replace PrintFriendly:

Consider using a robust PDF generation library for WordPress (e.g., GravityPDF or domPDF via custom PHP), giving greater styling control and output quality.

Front-End Libraries:

Use Chart.js or ApexCharts for interactive graphs.

Tailwind CSS for efficient, high-quality styling, responsiveness, and consistency.

WP Plugin Recommendations (for ease and quality):

Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for better-managed custom fields/data.

Gravity Forms or Typeform for premium questionnaire experience.

WPBakery or Elementor for visual consistency and ease of design adjustments.

Suggested Premium Report Layout Structure:
Cover Page (for PDF):
Client Name, Date

Premium branding/logo

Subtle image or gradient

Main Report Layout (Interactive webpage):
Introductory Section:

Clear summary with personalised greeting.

Biological Age Section:

Dial/gauge visualisation.

Short explanatory text.

Lifestyle Score Section:

Minimalist horizontal bar or gauge.

Body Composition Section:

BMI and WHR graphical visualisations (clean, minimalist).

Strengths & Areas for Improvement (Polar Chart):

Radar chart clearly labelled with key metrics.

AI Insights & Recommendations:

Accordion/drop-down for deeper insights.

Clickable, expandable sections for each recommendation.

Optional Iridology Insights (Image section with notes):

Clearly defined, highlighted.

Closing & Next Steps Section:

Call-to-action buttons clearly highlighted (Schedule, Contact Practitioner, etc.).

Part 2: Expertly Crafted AI Prompts per Section
Below are carefully engineered, high-quality AI prompts for each section. These prompts assume the AI has access to all the questionnaire data:

Section 1: Introduction & Summary
Prompt:

"You are writing the introductory summary for a premium longevity health assessment report targeted at a wealthy, discerning clientele. Using a warm, confident, and professional tone, summarise the client's overall health status, highlighting their biological age versus chronological age, and their lifestyle strengths. Keep it concise (50-70 words) and encouraging."

Section 2: Biological Age & Ageing Rate
Prompt:

"Clearly explain the client's biological age, chronological age, and rate of ageing in simple, positive terms suitable for a premium health report. Highlight positively if biological age is lower or gently indicate the need for improvement if higher. Encourage continuing good habits or initiating improvements as needed (max 60 words)."

Section 3: Overall Lifestyle Score
Prompt:

"Provide a concise yet insightful analysis of the client's lifestyle score (0-5), clearly stating their current level, briefly explaining what this indicates about their overall health habits, and encouraging them towards maintaining or improving this score (max 50 words)."

Section 4: Body Composition (BMI and WHR)
Prompt:

"Generate a clear, concise interpretation of the client's BMI and waist-to-hip ratio, specifically mentioning their health risk category. Explain briefly the health implications of these scores. If scores indicate moderate/high risk, provide encouraging and gentle language prompting actionable improvements (max 70 words)."

Section 5: Strengths & Areas for Improvement (Radar/Polar Chart)
Prompt:

"Analyse and summarise clearly and positively the client’s health data, listing 3-4 clear strengths first, followed by up to three primary areas for improvement. Use brief bullet points for clarity and easy readability, suitable for a premium client. Tone should be supportive and empowering."

Section 6: AI Personalised Health Insights
Prompt:

"Provide a premium, personalised health insight summary based on all the collected data. Emphasise the positive aspects of the client's current health and lifestyle while also addressing 2-3 specific priority areas for improvement. Keep it optimistic, actionable, concise, and supportive (max 80 words)."

Section 7: Personalised Recommendations & Strategies
Prompt:

"Generate specific, concise, and actionable health recommendations tailored explicitly for this client. Group recommendations into three clear categories: immediate actions (short-term), ongoing habits (long-term), and expert consultations or screenings. Each recommendation should include a brief (one-sentence) rationale and be presented positively and clearly."

Section 8: Optional Iridology Insights
Prompt:

"Provide a concise, intriguing, and professionally presented interpretation of iridology findings for this client, including strengths and areas of attention revealed by the iris analysis. Use premium, respectful language acknowledging that this is complementary holistic information that can support their longevity strategies (max 70 words)."

Section 9: Closing Inspiration and Next Steps
Prompt:

"End the longevity report on an empowering and motivating note. Emphasise the powerful ability of the body to regenerate and improve at any age. Encourage the client to adopt the identity of someone who naturally prioritises health, fitness, and wellbeing, using inspiring yet authentic language suitable for an upscale client (max 50 words)."

Section 10: Premium Call-to-Action (CTA)
Prompt:

"Write two short, premium-style CTA recommendations: One inviting the client to schedule a personalised follow-up consultation, and the other suggesting exploring advanced, exclusive longevity and wellbeing programmes. Use clear, concise, attractive language."

Final Notes on Implementing Recommendations:
Ensure the final digital and PDF reports reflect the exact brand identity of your premium naturopathic practice.

Regularly seek client feedback on the readability, clarity, and effectiveness of your layout, prompts, and recommendations.

Refine the AI model continually by reviewing actual client outcomes and feedback to further personalise and enhance its accuracy and effectiveness.

This comprehensive approach ensures your longevity report not only matches premium standards but also becomes a powerful tool in improving client engagement, satisfaction, and long-term outcomes.
